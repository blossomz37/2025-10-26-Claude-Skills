---

## Components Breakdown

### 1. SKILL.md (560 lines)
**Main orchestration file with:**

✅ **Decision Tree** - Visual workflow showing when to collect parameters, load references, and execute phases

✅ **User Variable Collection** - Step 1 collects:
- Genre (required)
- Target word count (required)
- Chapter count (required)
- POV preference (optional)
- Content rating (optional)
- Story structure (optional)

✅ **Conditional Logic** - Loads different reference files based on genre selection

✅ **Complete Workflow** - Three phases with detailed specifications:
- Phase 1: Foundation (premise, characters, outline)
- Phase 2: Chapter Loop (plan → draft → edit → final)
- Phase 3: Completion (continuity review, summary)

✅ **Quality Gates** - Verification checkpoints between phases

✅ **Progressive Disclosure** - Main instructions in SKILL.md, detailed guidance in references

---

### 2. Reference Files (4 files)

---

### 3. Validation Scripts (3 files)

**Purpose:** Deterministic quality checks after generation

**scripts/word_counter.py**
- Extracts all chapter drafts and finals
- Counts words per chapter
- Verifies minimum word count requirements (1500+ per chapter)
- Reports total manuscript word count
- Identifies chapters below minimum

**scripts/tag_validator.py**
- Parses all square bracket tags
- Ensures every opening tag has matching closing tag
- Identifies unclosed tags
- Detects mismatched closing tags
- Reports tag statistics
- Exits with error code if validation fails

**scripts/continuity_checker.py**
- Extracts character names from profiles
- Tracks character mentions per chapter
- Identifies characters with zero appearances
- Checks for potential name misspellings
- Reports character appearance patterns
- Helps catch continuity errors

## How This Addresses Your Concerns

### ❌ Original Version Problems:
- No decision tree
- No user variables
- No scripts
- No reference subdirectories
- Only one MD file

### ✅ Redesigned Version Solutions:

**Decision Tree:** 
- Visual flowchart in SKILL.md showing complete workflow
- Conditional logic for loading references
- Clear decision points (genre selection, parameter validation, loop control)

**User Variables:**
- Step 1 collects required and optional parameters
- Parameters control: genre guidance, word count targets, chapter count, POV, content rating, story structure
- Confirmation step before execution begins

**Scripts:**
- Three Python scripts for validation
- Deterministic checks (not Claude-dependent)
- word_counter.py ensures length requirements
- tag_validator.py ensures format correctness
- continuity_checker.py catches consistency errors

**Reference Subdirectories:**
- 4 comprehensive reference files
- Loaded conditionally based on parameters
- Progressive disclosure saves context tokens
- Contains detailed patterns Claude references during generation

**Multiple Files:**
- 8 total files (1 SKILL.md + 4 references + 3 scripts)
- Proper directory structure
- Each file serves specific purpose
- Follows skill-creator best practices

## Progressive Disclosure in Action

### Context Window Efficiency

**Always Loaded (Level 1):**
- Skill metadata (~100 words)

**Loaded on Invocation (Level 2):**
- SKILL.md main workflow (~3000 words)

**Loaded Conditionally (Level 3):**
- romance.md (~2000 words) - IF genre = Romance
- thriller.md (~2000 words) - IF genre = Thriller
- story-structures.md (~2500 words) - ALWAYS for structure selection
- dialogue.md (~3000 words) - ALWAYS for dialogue quality

**Never in Context (Level 4):**
- Scripts execute independently, results returned
- No script code loaded into context window

This design prevents context bloat while providing comprehensive guidance when needed.

## Usage Workflow

1. **User invokes skill:** "Write a romance novel"

2. **Parameter collection:** Skill requests genre, word count, chapters, POV, content rating, structure

3. **Reference loading:**
   - Loads romance.md (genre-specific)
   - Loads story-structures.md (structure selection)
   - Loads dialogue.md (universal)

4. **Phase 1 execution:** Creates premise, characters, outline using loaded references

5. **Phase 2 execution:** For each chapter:
   - Plans using structure beats + genre patterns
   - Drafts using dialogue guidelines + genre conventions
   - Edits with specific, actionable feedback
   - Finalizes addressing all issues

6. **Phase 3 execution:** Reviews continuity, generates summary

7. **Validation:** Runs scripts to verify quality and format
