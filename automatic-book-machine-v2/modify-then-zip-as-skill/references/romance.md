# Romance Genre Patterns

## Core Romance Requirements

### Mandatory Elements
- **Central love story** - Romance is the main plot, not a subplot
- **Emotionally satisfying ending** - HEA (Happily Ever After) or HFN (Happy For Now)
- **Focus on relationship** - The development of the romantic relationship drives the plot
- **Emotional journey** - Both characters must grow and change through love

### Character Requirements
- **Two protagonists** - Both romantic leads must be well-developed
- **Equal agency** - Both characters actively pursue the relationship
- **Internal conflicts** - Each character has emotional wounds/barriers to overcome
- **Chemistry** - Demonstrate attraction through dialogue, action, body language

## Pacing Guidelines

### Chapter Distribution (10-chapter structure)
- **Chapters 1-2**: Meet-cute or first encounter, establish attraction and conflict
- **Chapters 3-5**: Building tension, obstacles, getting to know each other
- **Chapter 6**: Major turning point, first intimate scene (if applicable)
- **Chapters 7-8**: Dark moment, misunderstanding, or external crisis
- **Chapter 9**: Resolution of internal conflicts
- **Chapter 10**: Commitment scene, HEA/HFN confirmation

### Scene Balance
- **40%** - Dialogue and banter (establishing connection)
- **30%** - Internal monologue (emotional processing)
- **20%** - Intimate scenes (escalating physical relationship)
- **10%** - External plot/obstacles

## Heat Levels

### Sweet/Closed Door (Fade to Black)
- Kissing and embracing shown
- Intimate scenes implied, not explicit
- Focus on emotional connection
- Language: romantic but not explicit

### Medium Heat (Moderate Sensuality)
- Intimate scenes shown but not graphic
- Focus on emotion during physical connection
- Sensory details without explicit terminology
- Language: sensual but tasteful

### High Heat (Explicit)
- Detailed intimate scenes
- Physical sensations described explicitly
- Multiple intimate scenes throughout
- Language: explicit but not crude
- **All participants must be 25+ and consenting**

## Romance Tropes (Optional)

Common patterns to enhance story:
- **Enemies to Lovers** - Conflict drives initial interactions
- **Friends to Lovers** - Established relationship deepens
- **Second Chance** - Former lovers reunite
- **Forced Proximity** - Circumstances force characters together
- **Forbidden Love** - External barriers prevent relationship

## Dialogue Patterns

### Banter and Flirtation
- Witty exchanges that reveal personality
- Teasing that shows comfort and interest
- Subtext - saying one thing, meaning another
- Physical reactions during conversation

### Vulnerable Moments
- Sharing fears and past wounds

- Asking for emotional support
- Naming the relationship/feelings

### Conflict Dialogue
- Misunderstandings based on fear/insecurity
- Arguments that reveal deeper issues
- Hurt statements that must be addressed
- Resolution dialogue that shows growth

## Intimate Scene Guidelines

### Building Tension
- Anticipation through multiple chapters
- Physical awareness before first touch
- Interrupted moments that delay gratification
- Internal monologue about desire

### Consent Cues (Essential)
- Explicit verbal consent or clear enthusiastic response
- Check-ins during escalation
- Characters confirm each other's comfort
- Respect for boundaries

### Emotional Connection During Physical Scenes
- Internal thoughts show emotional significance
- Dialogue during intimacy reveals vulnerability
- Physical sensations tied to emotional state
- Aftermath shows deepened connection

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Insta-love without development** - Show the falling in love process
- **Miscommunication for fake drama** - Conflicts should be meaningful
- **Passive protagonists** - Both characters need agency
- **Toxic behavior romanticized** - Possessiveness â‰  passion
- **Stereotypical gender roles** - Create balanced, modern dynamics
- **Weak supporting characters** - Secondary characters should be developed

### Second Act (Chapters 4-7)

### Third Act (Chapters 8-10)
