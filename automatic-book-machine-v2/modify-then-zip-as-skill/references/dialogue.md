# Dialogue Best Practices

## Core Principles

### Purpose of Dialogue
Every line of dialogue should serve at least one purpose:
- **Advance plot** - Move story forward
- **Reveal character** - Show personality, background, motivation
- **Create/resolve conflict** - Build or release tension
- **Convey information** - Deliver necessary exposition
- **Establish relationships** - Show dynamics between characters

### Natural Speech Patterns
- Use contractions (I'm, don't, can't)
- Vary sentence length
- Include interruptions and incomplete thoughts
- Match education level and background
- Regional or cultural speech patterns (use sparingly)

## Dialogue Tags

### Standard Tags (Preferred)
- **"said"** - Invisible, doesn't distract (use 80% of time)
- **"asked"** - For questions
- **"replied"** - When response needs clarification

### Action Beats (Alternative)
Replace tags with action:
> "I can't do this." She turned away from the door.

**Benefits**: Shows body language, maintains pacing, avoids tag repetition

### Tags to Avoid
- Adverbs: "angrily," "sadly," "nervously" (show emotion through dialogue itself)
- Over-dramatic: "exclaimed," "cried," "declared"
- Impossible: "laughed," "smiled," "shrugged" (can't speak while doing these)

---

## Subtext

**What is subtext?** The real meaning beneath the words spoken.

### Creating Subtext
- Characters say one thing, mean another
- Emotional undertones contradict words
- Cultural or situational context changes meaning
- What's NOT said is significant

### Example
> "Fine, you go ahead."  
> (Subtext: Not fine. Don't go. I'm hurt you're choosing this over me.)

## Voice Differentiation

Each character should have distinct speech patterns:

### Vocabulary
- Educated vs. casual
- Professional jargon
- Generation-specific terms
- Cultural references

### Sentence Structure
- **Character A**: Long, complex sentences
- **Character B**: Short, direct statements  
- **Character C**: Questions and hedging

### Verbal Tics
- Catchphrases (use very sparingly)
- Specific profanity or lack thereof
- Formal vs. informal address
- Hesitations or fillers ("um," "well," "you know")

---

## Exposition Through Dialogue

### Avoid Info Dumps
**Bad example:**
> "As you know, John, our father died ten years ago, leaving us this estate worth $5 million."

**Better approach:**
> "Ten years." John stared at the estate paperwork.  
> "Since Dad passed. Yeah."  
> "And we still can't agree what to do with it."

### Techniques
- **As-you-know-Bob** - Never have characters tell each other information they both know
- **Questioning** - New character asks, informed character explains
- **Conflict** - Information emerges during argument
- **Interruption** - Break up long explanations

---

## Dialogue Formatting

### Paragraph Rules
- New speaker = New paragraph
- Action by speaker stays in same paragraph
- Action by different character = New paragraph

### Example
> "We need to leave now." Sarah grabbed her keys.  
>  
> Mark didn't move from the couch. "Give me five minutes."  
>  
> "We don't have five minutes." She was already at the door.

### Punctuation
- Comma before dialogue tag: "I'm ready," she said.
- Period for action beat: "I'm ready." She stood.
- Question/exclamation preserved: "Are you ready?" she asked.
- Em dash for interruption: "I think we shouldâ€”"
- Ellipsis for trailing off: "I don't know..."

---

## Conflict in Dialogue

### Types of Dialogue Conflict
- **Direct confrontation**: Open argument
- **Passive-aggressive**: Subtext-heavy barbs
- **Misunderstanding**: Talking past each other
- **Withholding information**: One character knows more
- **Different goals**: Each character wants different outcome

### Techniques for Tension
- **Interruption**: Characters talk over each other
- **Silence**: Strategic pauses reveal discomfort
- **Non-answers**: Deflection and evasion
- **Escalation**: Volume, emotion, or stakes increase
- **Personal attacks**: Moving from issue to character

---

## Dialogue Pacing

### Fast Pacing
- Short lines
- Minimal tags
- Rapid back-and-forth
- Few action beats

**Example:**
> "Where is it?"  
> "Gone."  
> "Gone where?"  
> "Hell if I know."

### Slow Pacing
- Longer speeches
- Interrupted by action/description
- Thoughtful responses
- Internal monologue between lines

**Example:**
> "Where is it?" Marcus kept his voice level, though his hands trembled.  
>  
> Elena studied her coffee before answering. The morning light caught the steam rising from the cup, and she watched it dissipate before meeting his eyes. "Gone," she said finally.

## Genre-Specific Dialogue

### Romance
- Banter and flirtation
- Vulnerability building
- Confession of feelings
- Misunderstandings based on fear
- "I love you" scene requires buildup

### Thriller
- Terse, urgent
- Information extraction
- Threats and bluffs
- Minimal small talk
- Reveals and accusations

### Literary
- Philosophical depth
- Metaphorical language
- Subtext-heavy
- Character interiority reflected
- Natural meandering acceptable

### Fantasy
- World-building woven in
- Formal/archaic speech (if appropriate)
- Magic system explanations
- Cultural differences in speech

## Common Dialogue Mistakes

### Talking Heads Syndrome
**Problem**: Dialogue without action or setting
**Solution**: Ground dialogue in physical space

**Before:**
> "I can't believe you did that."  
> "I had to."  
> "You didn't have to lie."

**After:**
> "I can't believe you did that." She slammed the car door.  
> He gripped the steering wheel. "I had to."  
> "You didn't have to lie." She turned away, watching rain streak the window.

### On-the-Nose Dialogue
**Problem**: Characters say exactly what they feel
**Solution**: Add subtext, use indirect language

**On-the-nose:**
> "I'm angry at you for forgetting my birthday."

**With subtext:**
> "The cake was delicious. Amy's really thoughtful like that."

### Excessive Realism
**Problem**: Including every "um," "uh," hello/goodbye
**Solution**: Stylized realism - sounds natural but isn't transcription

**Too realistic:**
> "Um, well, I was thinking, you know, that maybe we could, like, go to dinner?"

**Stylized:**
> "I was thinking we could go to dinner. If you want."

### Info Dump Dialogue
**Problem**: One character lectures for paragraphs
**Solution**: Break up, add conflict, use action

## Dialogue Rhythm

### Vary Length
Alternate short exchanges with longer speeches:
- Short: Tension, action, conflict
- Long: Explanation, backstory, confession

### White Space
Paragraphs of dialogue create visual rhythm on page:
- Dense dialogue = fast pace
- Broken by action = moderate pace
- Long paragraphs = important speeches

### Sentence Variation Within Speech
Don't make every sentence the same length or structure within one character's speech.

## Testing Your Dialogue

### Read Aloud Test
- Does it sound natural spoken?
- Can you tell who's speaking without tags?
- Is pacing appropriate?

### Character Voice Test
- Remove tags - can you still identify speaker?
- Is vocabulary consistent with character?
- Does syntax match character's background?

### Purpose Test
- Does every line serve a purpose?
- Can any lines be cut without loss?
- Is exposition disguised effectively?

## Dialogue-to-Narrative Ratio

**By Genre (approximate):**
- **Romance**: 40-50% dialogue
- **Thriller**: 30-40% dialogue
- **Literary**: 25-40% dialogue
- **Fantasy**: 30-40% dialogue

Balance dialogue with:
- Action/movement
- Setting description
- Internal monologue
- Sensory details

Too much dialogue = talking heads  
Too little dialogue = narrator telling everything
