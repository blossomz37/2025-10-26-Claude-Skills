[chapter 1 draft]

The coffee in the BAU briefing room had gone cold an hour ago, but Nadia Reznik lifted the paper cup to her lips anyway, buying herself three seconds to study the crime scene photos without anyone watching her face.

Three victims. Six weeks. A pattern emerging like a photograph in developer fluid.

"Victim three, Melissa Hartwell, twenty-seven." Unit Chief Sarah Vance's voice cut through the morning hum of fluorescent lights and shuffling papers. "Found in Lincoln Park yesterday morning. Same victimology as the others—professional women, mid-to-late twenties, no obvious connection between them."

Nadia set down her coffee with careful precision. Around the table, eight other agents leaned forward, some taking notes, others studying the images projected on the screen. Marcus Chen sat to her right, close enough that she could sense his attention shifting between the briefing and her profile.

"Cause of death?" Agent Reeves asked from across the table.

"Strangulation. Manual, like the others. But there's something new." Vance clicked to the next slide.

The image filled the screen—close-up of pale skin marked with intricate black lines. Not a bruise. Not a wound. Something deliberate.

Nadia's hand moved to her left wrist before she could stop it. Her fingers found the thin silver bracelet she'd worn for five years, tracing the geometric patterns etched into the metal. The motion was unconscious now, a tell she'd never successfully trained herself to stop.

"The design was drawn on her left shoulder blade postmortem," Vance continued. "Medical examiner confirms it was created using the victim's own blood. Killer used something with a fine point—possibly a tattoo needle or similar implement."

The pattern on the screen was complex. Geometric lines wove into organic curves, mathematical precision flowing into natural forms. To anyone else in the room, it might have looked random, artistic but impersonal.

Nadia knew better.

She'd seen this exact design before. Or rather, she'd seen the artist who created variations of it—hundreds of variations—each one unique but unmistakably from the same hand. The same mind.

Julian.

The name hit her chest like a fist. She kept her expression neutral through sheer force of will, the same control that had carried her through FBI Academy, through her first dozen cases, through the morning five years ago when she'd woken up to an empty bed and an emptier apartment and no explanation at all.

"Nadia?"

Marcus's voice, quiet beside her. She turned her head half an inch, meeting his eyes. He'd noticed. Of course he had. They'd been partners for three years, longer than she'd been engaged to Julian. Marcus could read her microexpressions better than anyone except—

She shut down that thought.

"I'm fine," she said, voice level.

His eyebrow rose a fraction. Skeptical. But he didn't push, not here with the whole team present.

Vance clicked to the next slide. "The first two victims had similar markings. Different designs, but same medium—victim's blood, same placement, postmortem. Chicago PD originally thought these were unrelated cases, but the tattoo element establishes a signature."

"Has anyone cross-referenced with local tattoo artists?" Agent Reeves again, leaning forward. "This level of skill suggests professional training."

"That's our next step," Vance said. She pulled up a new image—a screenshot from Instagram, bright and casual against the clinical crime scene photos. "This was posted two days ago by a studio called Phoenix, in Wicker Park. Over fifty thousand likes."

The design on the screen was celebratory, commemorating the studio's reopening after—Nadia's stomach dropped—five years. The pattern was geometric flowing into organic, unmistakably the same style as the crime scene markings.

Phoenix Studio.

Julian's studio.

The one he'd built from nothing, the one where he'd proposed to her on a Tuesday afternoon with ink still drying on a client's shoulder, the one that had closed abruptly and completely the week before their wedding.

"The studio's lead artist is—" Vance checked her notes "—Julian Kade. Anyone familiar with the name?"

Silence. Around the table, heads shook.

Nadia kept her hands flat on the table, her breathing even. Said nothing.

She felt Marcus's attention sharpen beside her like a blade being drawn.

"I want a team on this today," Vance said. "We need to determine if there's a direct connection between this studio and our victims. Reeves, Cooper—pull all documentation on Phoenix Studio. Client lists, employee records, financials. Marcus, Nadia—" Vance's gaze landed on them "—I want you two to go in undercover. Potential clients interested in custom work."

"What's our cover story?" Marcus asked.

"Couple looking for matching tattoos. Something that requires multiple consultations, gives you time to get close to the artist and observe." Vance's expression was all business. "If Kade is our unsub, he's using his professional access to select victims. We need to see his selection process up close."

Nadia's pulse was too fast. She willed it to slow, counted her breaths the way her Academy instructor had taught her. Five years of distance, of carefully constructed walls, of convincing herself she'd moved past it.

Now she was going to walk back into Phoenix Studio and face the man who'd left her three weeks before their wedding with no explanation, no goodbye, no trace.

As a suspect in a serial murder investigation.

"Any objections?" Vance looked around the table.

This was the moment. Nadia could speak up, tell them she had a personal connection to the subject, recuse herself from the case. It would be the professional choice. The ethical one.

She thought of three women dead. Thought of the design drawn in blood. Thought of a killer with Julian's artistic signature and a forty-eight-hour kill cycle that meant someone else might die in two days if they didn't stop him.

"No objections," Nadia said.

---

The evidence room hummed with the white noise of climate control, keeping crime scene materials at optimal temperature. Nadia stood at the lightbox, studying high-resolution photos of the markings on all three victims, her mind cataloguing patterns with the automatic precision that made her good at this job.

The door opened. Marcus.

He didn't speak immediately, just came to stand beside her at the lightbox, hands in his pockets, studying the same images she'd been examining for the past twenty minutes.

"You recognized it," he said finally. Statement, not question.

Nadia didn't insult him by denying it. "The style. Yes."

"From?"

She pulled up the Instagram screenshot on her tablet, set it beside the crime scene photos. "This studio. Phoenix. The lead artist is—" She paused, then committed to it. "Someone I used to know."

Marcus turned to look at her fully. "Used to know how?"

"Does it matter?"

"You tell me." His voice was gentle but firm. This was Marcus in partner mode, the person who'd pulled her through the worst case of her career, who'd spent three Thanksgivings at her parents' house because he knew she dreaded going alone, who'd never once asked about the bracelet but had definitely noticed she never took it off.

Nadia met his eyes. "Julian Kade. We were engaged. Five years ago, he left three weeks before the wedding. No explanation. No contact since."

She watched Marcus process this, saw the connections forming behind his analytical gaze. The same gaze that made him one of the best profilers in the unit despite being five years younger than most of the team.

"The timeline," he said slowly. "Phoenix Studio closed five years ago. Just reopened."

"I noticed."

"When he left you, the studio closed."

"Yes."

"And now both have reappeared. Him and the murders." Marcus's expression shifted toward something protective, almost angry. "Nadia, you can't work this case. You know that."

"I'm the one who made the connection," she pointed out. "Without my recognition of the style, we'd have spent weeks chasing down tattoo artists. I just saved us time."

"That's not the point and you know it. You have a personal relationship with a potential suspect. That's a conflict of interest."

"Had. Past tense. And he's not necessarily a suspect. The killer could be copying his work."

"Could be," Marcus agreed. "But Vance is right—the level of skill suggests professional training. Someone who studied Kade's techniques intimately. And the timing of the studio reopening—"

"—could be coincidence. Or could mean Kade is being targeted specifically." Nadia turned back to the photos. "Look at the progression. The first marking was rough, unpracticed. By the third victim, the technique is cleaner. The killer is practicing."

"Practicing to replicate Kade's work perfectly. Why?"

That was the question Nadia had been circling since the briefing. Why copy Julian's style? Why announce it by drawing the designs in victims' blood rather than using actual tattoos?

"Message," she said. "The killer wants us to connect it to Phoenix Studio. Wants us to investigate Julian."

"Or wants to be closer to Kade's work because of obsession with him," Marcus countered. "Former client, maybe? Student? Someone who knows him personally?"

Both theories had merit. Nadia had spent the past twenty minutes generating a dozen more.

"I need to be on this case," she said quietly. "I'm the only one who can identify if someone is accurately replicating Julian's technique. The subtle differences between his work and an imitation."

"You're also emotionally compromised."

"Aren't we all, on every case?" She gestured at the photos. "You think I didn't notice you staring at Melissa Hartwell's file? Twenty-seven, works in tech, lives alone. Same description as your sister."

Marcus went quiet. She'd struck accurately, but it was necessary. They all brought their own ghosts to this job. The trick was not letting those ghosts make decisions for you.

"I can handle seeing him again," Nadia said. "I have to."

"Why?" Marcus asked softly. "Why do you have to?"

Because three women are dead. Because someone is using Julian's art to kill. Because I've spent five years wondering what happened, and now I need to know if the man I loved is capable of murder.

She didn't say any of that. Instead: "Because it's my job."

Marcus studied her for a long moment, then sighed. "If Vance finds out you have this connection and didn't disclose it, you'll lose more than this case. Could lose your position."

"Then don't tell her."

"Nadia—"

"I'm asking you as my partner. Give me forty-eight hours. If the killer follows pattern, we have that long before the next victim. Let me do the initial undercover contact. If I can't handle it, I'll recuse myself." She turned to face him fully. "Please."

The word hung between them. She rarely asked Marcus for anything, preferred to maintain the equilibrium of their partnership without tipping into the space where favors accumulated like debts. But this mattered. This was—

She couldn't articulate what this was, exactly. Unfinished business. A wound that had never properly healed because she'd never understood what caused it. The need to look Julian in the eyes after five years and see if she could finally understand why he'd left.

Or see if he'd been capable of this all along and she'd missed the signs.

"Forty-eight hours," Marcus said finally. "But I'm staying close. First sign you can't handle it, I'm pulling you."

Relief flooded through her. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. If this goes sideways, we're both screwed."

---

Phoenix Studio hadn't changed.

Nadia stood on the sidewalk across from the entrance, evening foot traffic flowing around her on the Wicker Park street. Above the door, the same sign—black metal with the studio's logo, a stylized phoenix rising from geometric flames. Julian had designed it himself, spent weeks getting the proportions exactly right.

Through the window, she could see the front desk area. Clean lines, industrial aesthetic, exposed brick walls covered in framed flash art. Some of the frames were new, but many she recognized. Julian's work from five years ago, preserved behind glass.

She'd been inside Phoenix Studio hundreds of times. Had met Julian there on their third date. Had brought him lunch during long sessions. Had said yes to his proposal in the private back room where he kept his personal equipment.

Had woken up the morning after he disappeared to find her key to the studio no longer worked, the locks changed, everything closed.

Her phone buzzed. Marcus: In position. Ready when you are.

He was in the coffee shop two doors down, monitoring from a distance. If anything went wrong, he'd be there in thirty seconds. It should have been reassuring.

Nadia crossed the street.

Up close, she could see the hours posted on the door. Open until nine p.m. on weeknights. It was seven-thirty. She had ninety minutes to walk in, pretend to be a potential client, observe Julian, and walk out without revealing that her entire world had just tilted on its axis.

She could do this. She'd faced down serial killers, interviewed psychopaths, maintained cover in situations that would have broken most people. This was just another case. Just another subject of investigation.

Just the man she'd planned to marry.

Nadia reached for the door handle. Her fingers trembled slightly—she clenched them into a fist, released, tried again. Steady this time.

The door was cool under her palm. Solid. Real.

She'd spent five years building a life without Julian Kade. Building a career that depended on her ability to read people, to see the truth beneath surfaces. If she couldn't face him now, couldn't walk through this door, then what did that say about all those walls she'd built?

Behind her, Chicago continued its evening rhythm. Cars passing, voices drifting from the restaurant next door, the city alive and indifferent to her small personal crisis.

Three women were dead.

Nadia pushed the door open.

A bell chimed, bright and familiar. The sound triggered a cascade of memories she'd worked hard to suppress—Julian looking up from his work, that half-smile that meant he was happy to see her. His hands, always moving, always creating. The way he'd kiss her hello, tasting like coffee and ink and something uniquely him.

The front desk was empty. From somewhere in the back, she heard music playing. Something instrumental, lots of bass. Julian had always worked to music, said it helped him think in rhythm.

"Be right there!" A male voice, muffled by distance.

Not his voice. Wrong timbre, wrong accent.

Relief and disappointment crashed through her in equal measure.

Footsteps approached from the back hallway. A man emerged—but not Julian. This man was younger, maybe mid-twenties, with a sleeve of ocean-themed tattoos and a bright smile.

"Hey, welcome to Phoenix. I'm Alex. Do you have an appointment or are you interested in booking a consultation?"

Nadia's prepared cover story came back online. "Consultation. I saw some of your work on Instagram. The geometric designs?"

"Oh, you'll want to talk to Julian then. That's his specialty." Alex moved behind the desk, pulling up a scheduling system on the computer. "He's with a client right now, but I can set you up for later this week if you'd like to discuss a custom piece?"

"Is he available tonight? I was hoping to at least meet him, see if his style matches what I'm looking for."

Alex checked the screen. "His last appointment should wrap up in about fifteen minutes. If you don't mind waiting, I can see if he has time to chat?"

"I'll wait."

"Great. Can I get your name?"

This was it. The moment of commitment. Once she gave her name, there was no pretending she'd stumbled in by accident. No claiming she hadn't known this was Julian's studio.

"Nadia," she said. "Nadia Reznik."

If Alex recognized the name—and if Julian had talked about her in the past, he might—he gave no indication. Just smiled and typed it in.

"Perfect. Have a seat, Nadia. Can I get you water or anything?"

"I'm fine. Thank you."

She moved to the waiting area, chose a chair that gave her a view of both the front door and the hallway leading to the back. Force of habit. Always know your exits.

The walls displayed Julian's evolution as an artist. She could see it in the chronological progression of the flash designs—from his early work, more traditional tattoo imagery, to the style he'd developed over time. The geometric flowing into organic. Structure and chaos in harmony.

She'd asked him once what it meant, that pattern. They'd been in bed, her fingers tracing the tattoo on his left forearm—a design that wrapped from his wrist to elbow, the same signature style.

"It's control and release," he'd said. "The geometric parts are what we try to impose on the world. Order, structure, rules. But the organic parts are what actually exists. Growth, change, entropy. Good art acknowledges both."

"Which one are you?" she'd asked.

He'd smiled. "I used to be all geometry. Then I met you."

The memory hurt like a fresh wound.

From the back of the studio, a door opened. Voices—someone thanking Julian for his work, Julian responding with quiet warmth. Footsteps in the hallway.

Nadia's pulse accelerated. She forced herself to breathe slowly, evenly. Prepared her face for the moment when—

A woman emerged from the hallway, beaming, showing Alex her newly wrapped forearm. Behind her, finally, was Julian.

Five years.

He looked the same and completely different. Still tall, still that careful way of moving like he was always aware of the space around him. But thinner now. Tired. His black hair was longer, touching his collar. The tattoos on his arms were the same, but his hands—those artist's hands she'd memorized—seemed older somehow. More weathered.

He was talking to Alex, not looking at the waiting area. She had approximately five seconds before he noticed her.

Nadia stood.

Julian turned.

Their eyes met.

She watched the recognition hit him—saw his face go absolutely still, watched color drain from his features. His hand moved unconsciously to his chest, fingers pressing against his sternum like he could slow his heart rate through sheer force of will.

The woman at the desk continued chatting with Alex, oblivious to the tension that had just crystallized in the room.

Julian recovered first. Or seemed to. He moved forward, professional mask sliding into place, but Nadia could see the micro-expressions underneath. Shock. Fear. Something that might have been longing, buried deep.

"Nadia," he said. His voice was rough, like the name hurt to say. "I didn't—I wasn't expecting—"

"I'm interested in a tattoo consultation," she said, voice cool and level. Professional. "Alex said you might have time to talk tonight."

She watched him process the statement, the formality of it. Saw him understand she wasn't here as his ex-fiancée. Was here as something else.

"Of course," he said after a beat too long. "Yes. We can talk now if you'd like."

"That would be good."

They stood there for a moment, neither moving. The weight of five years and a thousand unasked questions hanging between them like a physical thing.

Alex cleared his throat. "I'll, uh, finish closing out. Take your time."

Julian gestured toward the hallway. "My room is in the back."

Nadia walked past him, careful not to touch, not to get close enough to—

She still remembered what he smelled like. Ink and something clean, like rain on pavement. It was a detail she'd tried to forget and never could.

His private work room was exactly as she remembered. Same equipment, same lighting, same bulletin board covered in design sketches and photos. The chair where clients sat—she'd sat there once, letting him tattoo a small design on her hip that she'd later had removed because looking at it hurt too much.

Julian closed the door behind them. The music from the front area faded to a muffled baseline.

They were alone.

"How have you—" Julian started.

"I'm here on business," Nadia cut him off. She couldn't do small talk. Couldn't pretend this was a casual meeting between old acquaintances. "I'm with the FBI. Behavioral Analysis Unit."

She watched him absorb this information, saw the confusion flicker across his features.

"FBI," he repeated. "You're—you became an agent?"

"Three years ago."

He nodded slowly, processing. She could see him trying to reconcile this new information with the woman he'd known. The woman who'd been finishing her doctorate in psychology, who'd planned to work in private practice or academia. Not the woman who now carried a gun and chased serial killers.

"I'm working a case," Nadia continued. "Serial murders. Three victims. The killer leaves a design on the victims' bodies, drawn in their own blood. The design—" She pulled out her phone, showed him the crime scene photo she'd saved. "—matches your style."

Julian looked at the image. She watched his face carefully, cataloguing every microexpression. He went very still, the kind of stillness that came from conscious control. His breathing remained even but his pupils dilated slightly. Recognition, definitely. But horror too. And something else she couldn't quite identify.

"This is mine," he said quietly. "I mean—it's my style. But I didn't create this specific design."

"You're sure?"

"I'm sure. I'd remember." He looked up from the phone, met her eyes. "Nadia, I didn't kill anyone. I wouldn't—"

"I'm not saying you did. But someone with extensive knowledge of your work is using it. Someone who can replicate your technique precisely."

Julian handed back her phone, then moved to sit at his workstation. Not running, not defensive. He looked exhausted suddenly.

"How many victims?" he asked.

"Three. Young women. No connection between them except the designs."

"May I see the others?"

It was against protocol to show a potential suspect evidence. But she'd already crossed so many lines tonight. Nadia pulled up the other photos, handed him her phone.

Julian studied each image with the careful attention he'd always brought to art. She remembered watching him evaluate client requests, the way he'd examine reference photos, looking for not just what was shown but what was meant.

"They're progression," he said finally. "The first one—the technique is rough. Unsteady hand, inconsistent pressure. By the third, much cleaner. Whoever made these was practicing."

Exactly what Nadia had concluded. "Practicing to replicate your work perfectly."

"But why?" Julian looked up at her. "Why copy my designs to murder people?"

"That's what I need to find out. Starting with anyone who might have studied with you. Apprentices, former employees, clients who watched you work closely."

Julian's expression shuttered. "The studio's been closed for five years. Before that, I had two apprentices. Sam—Samara Okonkwo—still works here. She's been running Phoenix since I left. The other one moved to New York, last I heard. I can get you their information."

"I'll need client records too. Anyone who came in regularly, had multiple sessions."

"You think this is someone I knew."

It wasn't a question. Julian was smart, always had been. He could see the logic.

"People who kill with this level of ritual and symbolism are driven by personal connection," Nadia said. "If they're using your art, they have a relationship with you. Even if it's one-sided. Even if you don't remember them."

Julian stood, moved to his desk, pulled out a battered notebook. His movement was careful, controlled. She recognized the body language—he was holding himself together through sheer discipline.

"I'll cooperate fully," he said. "Whatever you need."

"Why?"

The question came out before she could stop it. Not professional. Not relevant to the case.

Julian looked at her across the small room. "Why what?"

"Why are you cooperating? Why did you come back to Chicago? Why reopen Phoenix Studio? Why—" She stopped herself before the real question emerged. Why did you leave?

"I came back because I thought it was safe," Julian said quietly. "Because I thought I could have my life again. My work. My—" He cut himself off. "I was wrong, apparently."

"Safe from what?"

His jaw tightened. "I can't explain. I wish I could."

The same non-answer he'd probably given himself five years ago. Nadia felt anger spark through her chest, hot and sharp.

"Three women are dead, Julian. If you know something that could help this investigation—"

"I don't know who's killing them," he interrupted. "I swear to you, I don't."

"But you know something."

He didn't deny it. Just looked at her with those pale blue eyes that she'd once memorized, that she'd spent five years trying to forget.

"I can't," he said. "I'm sorry. But I'll help however else I can."

Nadia wanted to push, to interrogate properly, to use every technique she'd learned to extract the truth. But they were alone in this room, the door closed, and the last time they'd been alone together—

She couldn't think about that.

"I'll be back," she said. "Likely with more questions. In the meantime, don't leave town."

"I'm not going anywhere."

There was weight in those words, subtext she couldn't parse.

Nadia moved toward the door, needed to get out of this room that smelled like ink and memory. Her hand was on the handle when Julian spoke again.

"Nadia."

She didn't turn around.

"I'm sorry," he said quietly. "For before. For leaving. I know that doesn't help now, but I'm sorry."

Five years of anger and grief rose in her throat. She wanted to turn around, to demand real answers, to ask the thousand questions she'd buried. Wanted to scream at him or maybe break down crying or possibly both.

Instead, she opened the door and walked out.

Alex was at the front desk, looking confused by the quick turnaround. Nadia managed a professional smile.

"Thank you for your time. I'll be in touch about that consultation."

She was out the door before anyone could respond, back on the street where the cool evening air hit her face like a slap. Her hands were shaking. Her entire body was shaking.

Across the street, Marcus was already moving toward her. She held up one hand—stop. Turned away and walked toward the coffee shop, needing a moment before she faced her partner's questions.

Behind her, through Phoenix Studio's window, she could see Julian still standing in the doorway of his work room, watching her leave.

Just like she'd watched five years ago when he left her.

Except this time, she was the one walking away.
