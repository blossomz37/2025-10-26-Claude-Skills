[chapter 1 plan]

CONTINUITY CHECK:
- Previous chapter ending: N/A (First chapter)
- Unresolved threads: N/A
- Character states: Nadia is established BAU profiler, five years past Julian's disappearance; maintains professional control but emotional wound unhealed; wears his bracelet daily

CHAPTER GOALS:
- Structure beat: Opening Image + Inciting Incident (Three-Act Structure Act 1)
- Plot advancement: Establish serial killer case, introduce connection to Julian through tattoo design recognition, set up undercover operation that will force Nadia-Julian reunion
- Character development: Nadia's professional competence and controlled exterior; hint at suppressed trauma through micro-reactions; establish partner dynamic with Marcus; reveal she's never fully moved on
- Emotional arc: Professional confidence → shock of recognition → determination to maintain control despite internal chaos

SCENE BREAKDOWN:
Scene 1: BAU morning briefing (FBI field office) - Establish Nadia's professional world, introduce case details, reveal new victim and evidence including tattoo design, Nadia's controlled reaction when she sees it
Scene 2: Evidence room with Marcus (private) - Marcus notices Nadia's tells, probes gently, Nadia deflects but confirms she recognizes design, establishes their partnership trust and his protective concern
Scene 3: Unit chief's office (assignment) - Briefing on undercover operation at Phoenix Studio, Nadia volunteers despite knowing Julian's connection, Marcus assigned as her "boyfriend" cover, Nadia's internal justification
Scene 4: Exterior Phoenix Studio (evening) - Nadia alone before entering, sensory details of Chicago street, memory fragments triggered by location, physical manifestation of suppressed emotion, decision to enter

GENRE-SPECIFIC ELEMENTS:
Romance: Establish Nadia's unhealed heartbreak through bracelet detail, memory fragments; set up reunion anticipation; Marcus's unspoken feelings hinted
Thriller: Open with crime scene evidence and victim count; establish ticking clock (killer's 48-hour pattern); create urgency and professional stakes; use tattoo design as visual hook; end with suspenseful door-opening moment

DIALOGUE STRATEGY:
- Nadia's speech: Precise, professional vocabulary with psychology/profiling terminology; clipped when under stress; uses analysis as emotional shield
- Marcus: Casual warmth with Nadia, pop culture references, becomes more formal with superiors; protective undertones in questions
- Unit chief: Authoritative, efficient, trusts team but maintains hierarchy
- Minimal dialogue in final scene (Nadia alone)—focus on internal monologue and sensory experience

TECHNICAL SPECS:
- POV: Nadia Reznik (third person limited)
- Target word count: 5,000 words (opening chapters run longer for worldbuilding)
- Pacing: Medium building to fast—start with procedural scene-setting, accelerate through recognition and decision, slow for emotional beat at door
- Chapter hook: Cliffhanger ending with sensory detail (bell chime, male voice) that creates anticipation for Julian's reveal in Chapter 2
