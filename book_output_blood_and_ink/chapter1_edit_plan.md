[chapter 1 edit plan]

STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
- Pacing: Generally strong with good rhythm variation. Scene 1 (briefing) moves efficiently, establishing case and characters. Scene 2 (evidence room) slows appropriately for emotional revelation. Scene 3 (implied—assignment scene) was compressed, could benefit from more detail about cover story setup. Scene 4 (outside studio and entrance) builds tension well but the final confrontation scene runs long—approximately 2,000 words of the 5,000+ total, which frontloads too much dialogue exposition.
- Scene balance: Good distribution across four planned scenes, though the studio interior deserves to be split conceptually into "entrance/waiting" and "private conversation" for better pacing beats.
- Chapter arc: Clear beginning (professional competence) → middle (emotional tension) → end (controlled retreat), fulfills three-act mini-structure within chapter.
- Structure beat: Successfully delivers opening image (Nadia's control) and inciting incident (tattoo recognition + case assignment), setting Act 1 in motion.

PROSE QUALITY:
- Show vs. tell: Strong showing in physical details (Nadia's bracelet touching, Marcus's eyebrow raise, Julian's color draining). Some telling in exposition chunks, particularly in evidence room scene where backstory is delivered through dialogue rather than woven organically. Line "She'd spent five years building a life without Julian Kade" is tell-heavy summary.
- Dialogue: Natural rhythm with good distinction between speakers. Nadia's analytical vocabulary works well. Marcus's protective tone clear. Julian's careful, wounded speech appropriate. However, some exchanges feel slightly over-explained—characters stating subtext that should remain implicit.
- Sensory details: Good visual details (cold coffee, lightbox photos, studio aesthetic) but missing other senses. More needed: sound (city traffic, studio music specifics), smell (ink, coffee shop, street), tactile (door handle temperature is good, need more).
- Word choice: Generally strong. Some weak verbs could be strengthened: "moved" appears 12 times—vary with more specific action verbs. "Looked/looked at" overused—37 instances.
- Sentence variety: Good mix of short and long sentences. Action scenes use fragments effectively. Some medium-length sentences could be broken for impact in high-tension moments.

CHARACTER:
- Voice consistency: Nadia's voice strong and consistent—analytical, controlled, professional vocabulary maintained throughout. Marcus distinct with casual warmth and protective edge. Julian's voice less developed in this chapter—needs more of his metaphorical speech patterns and artistic perspective established early. Alex (minor character) appropriately minimal.
- Behavior logic: Nadia's decision to stay on case despite conflict of interest is justified but could use more internal struggle to feel fully earned. Her professional mask cracks appropriately at key moments. Marcus's protection of her feels authentic to established partnership.
- Relationships: Nadia-Marcus dynamic well-established with history implied efficiently. Nadia-Julian tension palpable but needs more physical awareness/attraction beneath the anger to set up romance arc properly.

CONTINUITY:
- Plot logic: Solid. Case setup clear, investigation approach logical, undercover strategy makes sense.
- Character details: Nadia's bracelet established early and referenced consistently—good. Julian's ring (mentioned in character profiles) not yet introduced—should appear when he sees her to parallel the bracelet as symbol of their connection.
- Setting: Phoenix Studio described well but could use one more distinctive detail to make it memorable and unique (specific artwork, layout quirk, something that grounds the reader).
- Timeline: Clear—five years since Julian left, studio just reopened, murders began recently. No contradictions.

GENRE ADHERENCE:
- Romance: Setup effective—unresolved history, physical attraction implied but needs more explicit awareness, emotional wound clear. Missing: more of Nadia noticing Julian physically (his appearance, her body's reaction) to establish romantic tension alongside the hurt. The bracelet is excellent romantic symbolism.
- Thriller: Strong opening with crime scene evidence, clear stakes (48-hour kill cycle), victim count established, tattoo design as visual hook effective. Good use of professional investigation procedures. Ending cliffhanger works but could be sharper—currently ends on Nadia's reflection rather than immediate danger/mystery.

TECHNICAL:
- POV slips: Clean third-person limited from Nadia's perspective. No breaks. One potential slip: "Alex cleared his throat" during Nadia-Julian standoff—if Nadia can't see Alex from her position, this is POV violation. Check character positions.
- Tense: Past tense maintained consistently throughout. No errors.
- Grammar: Clean. One potential issue: "She'd been inside Phoenix Studio hundreds of times. Had met Julian there..." The second sentence fragment is stylistic but may be too informal for the tone established. Consider: "She'd met Julian there..."

SPECIFIC FIXES REQUIRED:

1. SCENE BREAK ADDITION (Line ~85, after Vance assigns the undercover operation): Add brief scene showing Nadia and Marcus receiving their cover story details and equipment. This grounds the undercover operation and provides transition. Insert 300-400 words showing them preparing fake IDs, discussing cover story as "couple," Marcus's concern about her emotional state. Ends with Nadia checking her reflection, preparing her professional mask.

2. SENSORY ENHANCEMENT (Throughout): Add specific sensory details beyond visual. Paragraph where Nadia enters studio: add smell of ink and antiseptic, specific song playing (not just "instrumental, lots of bass"—name a track or describe the melody). When Julian emerges: add sound of his footsteps, any specific visual details of his clothing. Street scene: add smell of evening (restaurant food, car exhaust, autumn air).

3. JULIAN'S RING REVEAL (During confrontation scene, when Julian's hand moves to his chest): Change to "His hand moved to his chest—no, his right thumb, where a silver ring caught the light. The matching piece to her bracelet, still worn after five years." This establishes the romantic parallel and his equally unhealed wound.

4. DIALOGUE TIGHTENING (Evidence room scene, Marcus and Nadia exchange starting "Used to know how?"): Remove Nadia's "Does it matter?" and Marcus's response. Instead, have Nadia answer directly: "Julian Kade. We were engaged. Five years ago, he left three weeks before the wedding." Cuts two lines of defensive dancing, makes reveal more impactful. Apply similar tightening to 3-4 other exchanges where subtext is over-explained.

5. PHYSICAL AWARENESS ADDITION (Final confrontation scene): After Julian says "I came back because I thought it was safe," add Nadia's physical reaction: "She noticed, despite everything, that he still moved the same way—careful, deliberate, like he was always aware of how much space he took up. She'd forgotten how tall he was, how his presence filled a room even when he was trying to make himself smaller." This grounds romantic tension in physical attraction beneath the anger.

6. OPENING PARAGRAPH STRENGTHENING: Current opening "The coffee had gone cold" is passive. Stronger option: "Cold coffee and three dead women. Nadia Reznik studied both with equal attention, though only one could tell her who the killer was." More immediate hook, establishes character voice and stakes faster.

7. CLIFFHANGER SHARPENING: Current ending has Nadia walking away in parallel to Julian leaving her—thematically nice but low tension. Instead, end with: "Behind her, through Phoenix Studio's window, she could see Julian still watching her leave. His phone was pressed to his ear now, calling someone. His face had gone pale, urgent. Afraid. Marcus appeared beside her. 'We've got a problem,' he said. 'Chicago PD just found another body. Victim four.'" This creates immediate forward momentum and raises stakes.

8. MARCUS CHARACTERIZATION DEEPENING (Evidence room scene): When Marcus says "You think I didn't notice you staring at Melissa Hartwell's file?" add internal reflection from Nadia: "She had noticed. His sister lived alone in Lincoln Park, same neighborhood as victim three. Marcus never mentioned it, but he'd checked his phone six times during the briefing." Shows their partnership depth without stating it directly.
