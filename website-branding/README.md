## 📞 Questions & Feedback

### Common Questions:

**Q: Why 20px instead of 16px?**  
A: 65+ readers have presbyopia (age-related farsightedness). Research shows they need 18-20px for comfortable reading. WCAG minimum (16px) is for general audiences.

**Q: Why change from blue to rose?**  
A: (1) Romance genre expectations, (2) Warm colors more visible for aging eyes, (3) Better emotional connection, (4) Blue retained as secondary option for Facebook familiarity.

**Q: Will this work on mobile?**  
A: Yes! Guidelines specify "never reduce below 18px on any device." Responsive breakpoints maintain readability and click target sizes.

**Q: What about younger readers?**  
A: Improvements help everyone! Larger text, better contrast, clear links benefit all ages. Only potential downside is fewer books per screen (4 vs 6), but this improves focus.

**Q: How long to implement?**  
A: 3-4 weeks for full implementation. Critical changes (Phase 1) can be done in 1 week for immediate impact.
