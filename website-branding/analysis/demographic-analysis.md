## Age-Related Design Considerations (65+)

### Visual Changes with Age

**Presbyopia (Age-Related Farsightedness):**
- Difficulty reading small text
- Need for larger font sizes (minimum 16px, prefer 18-20px)
- Reduced ability to focus on close objects

**Reduced Contrast Sensitivity:**
- Harder to distinguish similar colors
- Need for higher contrast ratios (aim for AAA standards)
- Light gray text becomes difficult to read

**Color Perception Changes:**
- Yellowing of eye lens affects color perception
- Blues can appear darker/duller
- Warmer colors (reds, oranges, pinks) remain more visible
- Avoid blue for critical information

**Reduced Light Sensitivity:**
- Need brighter, higher-contrast designs
- Avoid very light backgrounds with light text
- Pure white backgrounds work well

### Motor Skill Considerations

**Fine Motor Control:**
- Larger click targets needed (minimum 44x44px)
- More spacing between clickable elements
- Avoid small checkboxes or tiny icons

**Tremor/Precision:**
- Bigger buttons with more padding
- Hover states should be forgiving (larger hot spots)
- Avoid requiring precise mouse movements

### Cognitive Considerations

**Reduced Working Memory:**
- Clear, simple navigation
- Avoid complex multi-level menus
- One clear action per section

**Preference for Familiarity:**
- Traditional layouts work best
- Avoid trendy, unfamiliar UI patterns
- Keep design predictable

## Design Priorities for Improvement

## Specific Improvements to Consider

### Color Palette
**Current Issue:** Bright blue (#243be5) is very modern/tech, not romantic
**Improvement:** Add warm accent colors while keeping blue for familiarity
- Soft rose/pink for romance feel
- Warm cream/beige for softness
- Keep blue but use sparingly

### Typography
**Current Issue:** 16px may be too small for 65+ readers
**Improvement:** Increase to 18-20px base size
- Larger headings (H3 should be 26-28px, not 20-24px)
- More line spacing (1.8-2.0, up from 1.6)
- Maintain Lora serif (good choice for this audience)

### Buttons
**Current Issue:** May be too small for accurate clicking
**Improvement:** Larger buttons (16-18px padding, up from 10-12px)
- Minimum 48x48px clickable area
- More contrast in hover states
- Warmer color option

### Layout
**Current Issue:** 6-column grid may make books too small
**Improvement:** Reduce to 4 columns max on desktop
- Larger book covers
- More breathing room
- Easier to see details

### Color Contrast
**Current Issue:** #666666 and #aaaaaa may be too light
**Improvement:** Darker grays for better contrast
- Secondary text: #555555 instead of #666666
- Eliminate #aaaaaa for body text
